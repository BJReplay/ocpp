- [Alfen - Eve Single Pro-line](https://alfen.com/en/ev-charge-points/alfen-product-range)
- [Alfen - Eve Single S-line](https://alfen.com/en/ev-charge-points/alfen-product-range)
- [EVLink Wallbox Plus](https://www.se.com/ww/en/product/EVH3S22P0CK/evlink-wallbox-plus---t2-attached-cable---3-phase---32a-22kw/)
- [Evnex E Series & X Series Charging Stations](https://www.evnex.com/)
- [Wallbox Pulsar](https://wallbox.com/en_uk/wallbox-pulsar)


## Devices with known issues
- [EVBox Elvi](https://evbox.com/en/products/home-chargers/elvi?language=en) appears to require a secure connection, which we do not support (yet).

## Debugging

To enable debug logging for this integration and related libraries you
can control this in your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`
file. Example:

```
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.ocpp: critical
    websocket: debug
```

After a restart detailed log entries will appear in `/config/home-assistant.log`.
